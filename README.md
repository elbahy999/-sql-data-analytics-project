## **Project Requirements**

#### Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

## Objective
To build a modern SQL Server data warehouse that integrates sales data from disparate sources, enabling powerful analytical reporting and data-driven decision-making.

### Key Specifications
- **Data Ingestion:** Extract and import data from two primary source systems—an ERP and a CRM—provided in CSV format.
- **Data Preparation:** Implement cleansing and transformation processes to address and resolve data quality issues.
- **Data Modeling & Integration:** Develop a unified, optimized dimensional data model (e.g., star schema) that integrates both data sources for efficient analytical querying.
- **Project Scope:** The initial phase will focus on the most current dataset; slowly changing dimensions (SCD) and full historization are out of scope.
- **Documentation:** Deliver clear, comprehensive documentation of the ETL processes and data model for both technical and business stakeholders.
